Open Source release

Dear users of ROA. Thanks for the ongoing support - you may or may not know that ROA releases always where Open Source / GPL releases, even though the addon was only available through the Blendermarket.

It happened in 2019 that I became severely sick and had to undergo multiple surgeries with a long lasting pneumonia in between - I haven't fully recovered to this date. At the same time the Blender Foundation decided to make the jump to Blender 2.8 and turn the Python API upside down without providing documentation. I tried to cope with this as good as possible and released alpha and beta versions of my addons close the 2.8 launch. Later I "hired" an external developer to make the addons fully compatible with 2.8, yet he also wasn't 100% successful - although I'm thankful for his contributions.

Another change in my freelance business happened during that time period and I specialised more and more on IT Security were I see my future career right now.

I'm sorry to say that I can no longer contribute to my own addons, I really hope for someone to pick them up and make them great again. ;) I would love to see one or more of them bundled with Blender in the future.x
